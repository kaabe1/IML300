    <p1> Gen Hoshino is a popular J-pop artists often known for his bubbly and upbeat songs. In Spirng 2020, right when Japan implemented a national lockdown due the spread of the corona virus, Gen Hoshino uploaded a short video of him singing and playing the guitar. The song was titled "Uchi-de-orou" or as noted in the English version, "Dancing on the Inside." As this song spoke about the importance of staying inside as a way to keep our connections in the future, Gen Hoshino invted everyone online to use his song to remix and get creative. This started a whole social media movement or the "#Uchi-de-orou" trend, where celeberties and people all over the national and internationally used his song to create choreography, animations and even remixes. Gen Hoshino uplifted the artistry of those who remixed "Uchi-de-orou" by reposting their work on his Instagram story. <br><br> This project serves as an archive of a variety of individuals animation works as they all string together to narrarate the song lyrics. The project title adds on the Japanese word, "iishoni" as a way to emphasize the collabrative artisty Gen Hoshino initiated thorough his musical works.</p1>
          
      <h5> <span class="projectTitle"><u>Project 2 | Algorithmic Pattern and Sound </u></span><br><br><a href="p5Gallery.html">ALL P5 SKETCHES</a> | <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/kaabe1/full/R4T9pNm37">STARGAZER RADIO</a> | <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/kaabe1/full/kJYSXrydY">STARGAZER MUSIC VIDEO</a> </h5>
   <p1>"Stargazer" by End of the World illustrates the mundate and repetitive lifestyles of humans in the modern captialistic world. The song intros with a pop pinao feature, thus the animation presents itself to be bubbly and pastel themed. However, as soon as the lyrics start, the color tone and aninmation feel changes to match the thought provoking lyrics. <br><br> End of the World is one of my personal favorite J-pop/rock bands, I wanted to present their work along with my artistry. These lyrics resonate with my frustrations of the world and even myself espcially during quarantine as I felt unproductive and useless-- just gazing at the stars. I hope these lyrics makes one wonder if they are the stargazers? or the stars.<br><br>This project serves as a radio station for the various remixes of "Stargazer" by End of the World. Upon entering this radio, one has the option of 4 different radio stations '0' set as a piano cover, '1' set as the original "stargazer," '2' set as "stargazer (Reimagined)," and '3' set as "stargazer" or "スターゲーザー" by Sekai no Owari, End of the World's Japanese band identity. This radio was programmed so the audience can easily switch back and fourth through remixes while the song progresses and compare the variation in beat and lyrics. I created this radio as a way to present the ways in creativity can produce multiple forms of one original piece, and also wanted to utilize this as a way to share End of the World's artistry.</p1>

   <p1>The Hawai'i State Youth Commission (HiYC) consists of 15 youth nominated youth working to amplify youth voices in Hawaii's government. This project introduces and provides HiYC with online presence and ability to showcase HiYC’s past, current and future works. Although this platform is only the bare-bones of what the Hawai'i State Youth Commission has achieved so far, I hope this serves as a stepping stone into allowing HiYC to serve as a the semi-autonomous Commission as it is supposed to. By spreading awareness of the Hawai'i State Youth Commission, hopefully would empower Hawai’i youth to know t they have a gateway in having their voices heard in government.
<br><br>
The Hawai'i State Youth Commission (HiYC) has recently faced hurdles in creating their online presence by “gatekeepers” and the “adults” who have “control” over the Commission. When the Commission proposed to create their own Instagram and Facebook as a way to connect to the youth community, we were met with opposition. While other Commissions (such as the Commission on the Status of Women) were instantly granted autonomy over creating their own platforms, HiYC was presented with arguments it would be hard for youth to manage their own social media presence just because they are “youth.” This form of opposition is yet another example of how youth are often silenced and undermined of their abilities. The creation of a webpage also presents to be an issue, as currently, the youth have to depend on the “adults” in the government / department to process our request of creating the website on our behalf. Although the Youth Commission has shown integrity and presented the department with all the materials needed to build the governmental webpage, it has seem as though the department is late to respond— delaying HiYC’s ability to establish their webpage presence. The creation of this project looks to stand above these oppositions and reliance of the government or “adults” in the department and illustrates the capability of youth to create the representation they need.</p1>
