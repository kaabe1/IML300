      <p>“Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age” by Lara Baladi explores the ways in which the internet has allowed more individuals to document history and use media forms as an archive all around the world. Events such as the 2011 uprise in Egypt to other global protests around the world illustrates how digital archiving has empowered individuals to go against political power and display the true realities of the world. The author shares her experience as a “young artists” who found the internet as a safe space as she was able to “move away from private galleries, avoiding the state-owned spaces to open new avenues for creativity.” <br> <br>

However, upon reading the article, I found this line to be intriguing,  “But what the media called the 'Facebook Revolution' was only true for a couple of million out of the 90 million Egyptians who had access to the Internet.” I found it interesting how the internet is often times found to be a place of accessibility and collaboration amongst all, but is far from the truth. Although, it is the most inclusive people can be now, the classism and range in accessibility to the internet proves that some stories are often times left untold. My question is, who is responsible for archiving those stories that are untold? If another people or group is in charge of archives for them, would that defeat the purpose of this natural flow of archiving in the individuals hands? Would archiving also serve as a harm for certain communities if they do not want to exist in the online world?
  <br> <br> Paul Soulellis explains the use of digital media as a form of a snapshot in history as a tool to examine the past, present and future. Soulellis mentions his launch of QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK to collaboratively examine the ever-changing understanding of queerness. URGENCY LAB also experiments with how design is integrated in highlighting urgency of modern political issues and through these works came with the understanding of "delayed urgency</p>

      <p>“Computer technology was initially created by mostly women and were often referred to as “computer girls” in the post-WW2 era. Women took lead in programming and computer science, which resulted in women actually creating the first computer program in English— making it easier to read and understand. However, upon process of man washing, woman were soon replaced by men who took over the job force. This resulted in the US Department of Defense to create the first internet with purpose to withstand nuclear attack during the Cold War. The internet lives off of wires and the connection of different hosts all dialing into the same wire. In fact, the first global connection was possible through the Inter-continental Telegraphic Infrastructure.” <br> <br>

Understanding the history of the internet and computer science has opened my eyes to how issues of colonialism and gender roles extend beyond what we see in our daily life. The issue of man-washing reminded me of the documentary, “The Social Dilemma” as employees of large social media corporations express the capitalistically driven force of programming and social media use. The documentary highlights how the CEO’s of these companies tend to be white males, once again illustrating how this demographic has been manipulating and have agency over millions of people’s information. The history of the internet being created by the US Department of Defense also illustrates how he internet was initially created not for socialization purposes. The internet is far more “physical” than I thought and through this reading I found how the internet is a true reflection of our current society.</p>

      <p>“From American’s first tech-hub “Sillicon Valley” being birthed from white males from Stanford and its funding from the National Defense, it is clear that the birth of this technological age was lacking diversity from the start. In fact, ”the transition of the computer interface from a black screen, to the white screen of the 70s,” is symbolistic of how whiteness dominated the industry. White-washing and anti-blackness persists through the internet and the technological field as the history and its core power holders perpetuate this system. 
    In terms of UX design, there is an interesting juxtaposition as modern innovations to enhance the “user experience” has actually removed the user from being a being able to program and script like the time before. Interface interactivity is also a critical portion in allowing individuals to believe war simulates a game. As interactivity is lessened with modern technology, the user is removed from computerized weapons of war. The UX design experience has consequences beyond the computer screen but has societal consequences, just as the how the tech industry has underlying racial."</p>
    <p class="question"> Would giving UX power to individuals bring more freedom or danger to our online environment?
With recent integration of apple and “dark mode” interfaces, does this symbolize a step towards breaking down anti-blackness or is it just another UX design choice made by white tech CEOs?
If technology its self and its costs poses issues of classism, will the internet ever be considered to bring equality among all races and class?</p>

      <p>“Heather Dewey-Hagborg brings attention to the issues with biological surveillance through her artistic works of using stranger’s DNA left around the city. Not only does Dewey-Hagborg highlight how our biological information is constantly available and stored, but also presents “Stranger Visions” or project that is created between art and biopolitics. Lauren McCarthy also presents issues with surveillance as she shares her project of giving people physical followers. McCarthy also presents the ideologies of individuals wanting followers on social media and its ties to gender roles and understanding of the social network. Sydette Harry’s article addresses how surveillance touches upon a variety of social and liability issues. For instance, as the digital world expands Harry raises a question of how ones “voluntary” inclusion to the digital word sets the boundaries for privacy."</p>
    <p>As we leave our trace or DNA all over the environment without us knowing, would our digital footprints also be something that’s inevitable?

Why is follower count so closely related to fame, especially when those with higher follower count on social media tend to craft their social image and furthers the reality from an authentic “following” experience.

As surveillance or digital surveillance is closely tied to ones accessibility to technology, does this mean that those who have the money to stay digitally connect risk more of their surveillance?</p>

      <h5>Week 7 | 03/04/2021 </h5>
      <p>“Xiao Mina discusses the cross-over between internet meme culture and modern politics. She explains how memes and its ability to spread across social media easily, works as a way to spread awareness and information about social movements. Within these memes also consists ‘poor images’ and, as explained by Hito Steyerl, are a reflection of society. As images come in a variety of forms, high resolution images may be associated with higher quality in storytelling, however Steyerl points out that ‘poor images’ are also just as impactful with its own stories as it reflects reality. Similarly, “Glitch Studies Manifesto” by Rosa Menkman fights against the stigmatization against imperfect technolgoies. Menkman argues that glitches in technologies are not an error, but rather the birth of something new and creative. She incorporates this theme in her manifesto as each page is designed with a different “glitch.”"</p>
    <p>Although "glitches" can be considered art, if it hinders one ability to express themselves through technology, is it still considered something celebratory. Going off of the question above, if these glitches also only occurs (or occur more frequently) for some individuals due to their lack of accessible technology and hinders them from being able to use technology as intended... perhaps considering  "glitch" to be art is a privilage? Has meme culture ever done more harm than good? For instance, spreading misinformation and fear?

      <p>“Joy Buolamwini shares the issues with how algorithms also have bias and create inequality and injustices within society due to its use. These biased technologies also spread quickly within the internet causing these inequalities to persist globally. As these technologies are utilize in society now for crime and computation for law enforcement and war, Buolamwini urges developers, government and society to regulate technology and algorithm to ensure these biases are eliminated.

Mimi Onuoha explore the issue of how widespread data collection could be beneficial in spreading accurate and more representative information to society. Onuohua explains these phenomenon through her project of location tracking and how those data sets tell a narrative.

Stephanie Dinkins emphasizes similar points brought forth by Joy Buolamwini as she highlights how changes in the development of technologies and reconsideration of technological regulation is key to  "reconstruction of an intersectional black politics." As the tech industry was built during the time where white males were put at the top, these technological biases will not be replaced until there is diversification within the industry itself."</p>
    <p>Would inability for facial recognition in some ways be considered to protect the black community from police surveillance or do more harm?  How can the government impose laws to regulate diversification in the use of certain technologies? How can we expand data sets within the tech industry while ensuring that privacy and safety of individuals are kept under contro

      <p>“Morehshin Allahyari brings awareness to how bans against western cultures such as toys are often put in place in the physical world,  meanwhile the internet is often creating censorship on its own without people noticing. Allahyari points out how an outsider may see that to be irrational, similarly one should try push to understand the normalized censorship put in place in the digital world. Olivia McKayla Ross further emphasizes our digitalized world and how white supremacy is normalized through the day-to-day use of the internet. She also highlights how one should "prioritize love over likes" as a way to emphasize how the internet has numerified ones fame and popularity. Olivia Ross encourages readers to question the integrated algorithm and make daily choice to
 change the system we live in. Similarly, on p5.js the movement to bring inclusivity highlights how often technology is made in a US and English-centric format. Even in p5.js Olivia pushes the reader to consider the humanity within technology and an expansion to go beyond who it is built for now."</p>
    <p>What can we do in our daily life to push away the racist algorithm that has been put in place? Is there really a time where the algorithim will not became biased? Would removing this algorithm make life harder in any way?

      <h5>Week 10 | 03/25/2021 </h5>
      <p>“Ari Melenciano presents new methods and approaches to designing future lifestyles. She utilizes examples such as “By us for us” as a way to illustrate the need for individuals who will be served the design to take part in the design. She specifically brings up emphasis on creating a sustainable black future using circular design. Through criticism of capitalistic ideals embraced like big tech companies like Apple, Melenciano mentions that circular design is the key to sustainability. She encourages individuals to work as a visionary and not a reactionary to better build design that suits the greater community.

Hamid Khan the founder of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition adds on to the idea of technology enables racism especially in the field of policing. One of Khan’s core values includes abolishing or dismantling the system as reformist works will not bring the change society needs. As the current system has been prepetuated for years since the time when slavery was legal, utilizing technology or algorithm will only reinforce what has been practiced. Khan highlights that the use of techonology in the policing system also starts with experimentation on individuals, which dehumanizes individuals and adds to the idea of surveillance capitalism.

Similarly, with woman’s rights and the dismantling of the patriarchy, Audre Lorde identifies how the patriarchy has trained many women to believe that their beliefs and concerns are invalid to overturn the system. Lorde points out that women are oftenn challenged to “stretch across the gap of male ignorance and to educated men as to our existence and our needs.” Lorde analyzes that this method of having women endlessly occupied is a tactic by the oppressor. In conjunctions to women’s issues, Lorde encourages the audience to understand how racism and homophobia also ties in with this and “reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there.”"</p>
    <p>Should underrepresented and under-privileged individuals be given priority over the "privilaged" in internships or job positions as a way to push for a more inclusive design team?

As technology has infiltrated society and the policing systems already, would the answer be to "abolish the police" entirely?

Infographics, especially on social media, strive to educate the "uneducated" however does this just feed into the tactic of the oppressor as brought up by Lorde?
